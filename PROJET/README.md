# Blood Donors Website – Nonprofit Project (Freha, Tizi Ouzou, Algeria)

##  About the Project
This project was developed in the context of my Bachelor's degree for a **nonprofit blood donation association** in Freha (Tizi Ouzou, Algeria).  
The main goal of the website is to **facilitate blood donations** by connecting **donors** with **patients and associations** in need.

It was built as a **real-world solution for a social cause**, aiming to support humanitarian initiatives in my region.
